This study presents the use of the Spago4Q platform by the Veneto region (regione Veneto), Italy, which in this way supports its goal to provide quality services to citizens, to enterprises and to its employees. The project discussed in this study demonstrates how the Spago4Q platform can foster the improvement of the implementation process quality and the transparency of communication among the actors involved in the development process. Through Spago4Q, involved actors can jointly verify the quality of performance through data analysis based on predefined SLAs built on well identified metrics. The Spago4Q platform is maintained by Engineering, it is licensed though GPL and it is hosted in the OW2 forge.</p>

These steps included the elaboration of its Open Source Policy and Directive documents, which in parallel to the continuous update of the “Adopted Specifications” standard are levelling the field for IT solution providers in Malta. This initiative is especially welcome in Malta where most of the IT environment (the infrastructure, enterprise systems, but also IT education and eSkills-improvement initiatives) are focusing primarily on commercial proprietary software solutions.</span></p>

This study presents the use of the jAPS 2.0 Entando open source platform to build the Italian Civil Protection Department web portal that constitutes an interesting example of how open source technologies can be used to fulfil the legal requirements in place for public websites. The Civil Protection Department portal presents several features of interactivity and innovation that have never before been available in the Italian public administrations. The jAPS 2.0 Entando platform, maintained by Tzente, is licensed though GPL and it is hosted in the&nbsp;Joinup forge. </span></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"></span></p>

Two universities, one from each country, cooperated in the Open Kvarken project in order to explore the use of OSS by public administrations. The name of the project is symbolic, as Kvarken is the name of the Archipelago that separates (or unites) the two neighbours. The project in three years has shown interesting examples of OSS use in the public sector and the operation of two centres of open source knowledge, in Vaasa, Finland and Umeå, Sweden.</span></li>

Introducing Open Source Software communities to Europe's public sector</span></a></span></strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">: In the early 2000s the European Commission had realized the potential of open source software and its communities for the public sector. As the topic gained on importance the Commission launched the GPOSS portal, which was essentially a source of providing information regarding open source software for public administrations. Eventually the GPOSS portal was replaced by another platform, which allowed for actual cooperation of projects: OSOR.eu. This platform aimed at introducing public administrations to open source software and also to the community dynamics behind the software. It features a variety of projects and has several partnering websites, which contribute to further expanding the network.</span></li>

After experiencing a vast increase in requests for their services in 2006 and 2007, the Mapping Authority also had to deal with an increasingly overstrained IT infrastructure. The licenses for their infrastructure however were very costly, and acquiring additional licenses would only increase the financial burden consistently in the future. The Mapping Authority therefore chose to employ an IT infrastructure based on open source software solutions, which were free of licensing costs and which proved to be much better, performance wise. In the process of introducing the new IT infrastructure, the team had to build up own expertise in order to maintain a functioning system. With the help of online communities, this has been a great success for the Mapping Authority.</span></li>

The previous ICT platform was very costly and obliged the Police to stick with a hand full of vendors. The aim was therefore to cut costs, avoid vendor lock-in, achieve better performance, and introduce open standards. Before ideas were realized, a thorough study was conducted to calculate costs and benefits. This study foresaw cost savings of up to fifty percent over a five years period compared to the proprietary hardware and software in place at this time, while improving performance at the same time. Due to the dimensions of this project that affected the entire ICT infrastructure of the Swedish National Police, it was not always easy to turn ideas into reality.</span></li>

A team with different sub-tasks was formed, which investigated future learning environments and how learning material was presented and disseminated through those. Next to this, the OU also researched open learning models, as part of the OpenLearn project. The team of researchers and technical staff, after setting out the components required to meet the OU's needs the most appropriate match was determined. The choice fell on the VLE Moodle, which is an open source product. Today the Moodle VLE has been successfully implemented at the OU and the OU has further published a significant amount of their learning material under a Creative Commons license as courses on the Moodle VLE based OpenLearn website, which are freely available to anyone interested. The OU continues to collaborate closely with the Moodle community, as this provides a very large platform for feedback and information. All the OU's development is given back to the Moodle community, which improves the product for the OU and the rest of the community.</span></li>

		<strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/software/page/desktop4education"><span style="color: blue;">Desktop4education: Bringing new environments to Austrian schools</span></a></span></strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">: In 2003 the secondary school of Weiz, Austria, started the development of an open source operating system. The overall objective has been to develop a system that was easy to maintain, sustainable in the future, and free of licensing costs: the so called desktop4eduation. Although open source software is not extensively used in Austrian schools yet, it is becoming more and more important, as the government tries to promote free software over proprietary solutions increasingly. Today the desktop4education project is being frequently used as a reference case by the Austrian Federal Ministry for Education, Arts and Culture and as such promoted by them throughout Austria.</span></li>

The project's objective was to improve the air quality monitoring system currently in place and to enhance the system with forecasting capabilities. For the management of all the information and the presentation thereof, the team at the NMA developed a portal that is entirely built on Free/Libre Open Source Software. In the future, the team is hoping to open the project to the public.</span></li>

The solution had to be secure, adaptable, and fully featured. The IT direction of the city of Arles was in close contact with the open source initiative OpenMairie, which presented many software products for the use in the public sector. It was through this relationship that the four municipalities took the initiative to start OpenCimetiere, an open source management system for cemeteries. This was started with an initialization phase in 2006, followed by a contribution phase in 2007, where the software was further improved and extended. Today, the software is used by over 300 municipalities inside and outside France, and helps an increasing number of municipalities all over the world to manage their citizens' final resting places efficiently.</span></li>

The solution was developed with open source tools, as a common effort of all seven municipalities of the Kongsberg region. Once the project was working successfully, other municipalities and organisations became interested and wanted to use the portal as well. The Kongsberg region eventually published FriKomPort, as the portal was called, as a free software application under the GPL. The portal today is used by more than 50 organisations, and practically all users are very confident about the solution. For the future the FriKomPort leaders hope to share the portal with even more municipalities by publishing an English version.</span></li>

		<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: blue;">Eurostat: Standards and open source software for data interoperability: </span></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Eurostat collects and publishes huge amounts of data each year, and exchanges many datasets with other large organisations. This exchange was constantly suffering from a lack of interoperability, as data needed to be converted from one organisation's convention into another, a process which consumes both time and money. Different organisations were also using very different tools to work with the data, which caused further problems. In late 2001, Eurostat got together with a number of EU committees to discuss the need for greater interoperability within the European public sector. In 2005, IDABC agreed to fund the SDMX Open DATA Interchange (SODI) project. Thanks to previous cooperations between Eurostat and other international institutions, the SDMX standard quickly found a large group of sponsors, all of which hoped to benefit from the greater interoperability afforded by using a single standard, and the tools built on it. These tools were developed by Eurostat and other sponsoring institutions, and many of them were published under the EUPL license. The SDMX Converter is an example of the successful development and publication of a tool that is essential for working with the SDMX standard.</span></li>

While the Ministry of Agriculture has documented vineyards and crops for more than 20 years, this documentation was previously not up to EU standards. When Hungary became an EU Member State in 2004, the wine sector had to start providing standardized documentation in order to be eligible for funding under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). For this reason, the state-owned company FÖMI developed the national vineyard register VINGIS. It opted to base its solution on open source software in order to keep the system flexible and costs low. Although the development proved difficult, the final product is benefiting approximately 200.000 people between public bodies and wine-growers.</span></p>

The municipality of Grosseto was not satisfied with the resulting application, which had technical shortcomings as well as a restrictive license, and decided to develop its own system based on open source and open standards. In the process, Grosseto became part of an international network of public bodies working on open source eID solutions. </span></p>

The centre's main aim is to promote open source software in the public and the private sector. Initially the centre started with an annual government-funded budget of € 150.000. Today, COSS has more than 140 members, and is actively involved in the Finnish open source ecosystem. While its services have been mostly addressed to small and medium sized businesses as well as the public sector, the centre is trying to broaden its range of services to address the end user. </span></p>

This move was necessary, as the previously deployed all-in-one platform that was used since the early 1990s could no longer meet the needs of the Federal Court. With this also came the introduction of open source applications such as Gnome, Firefox and the Evolution mail client. Among the goals were vendor independence and the implementation of open standards. The IT solution was extended to the newly formed Swiss Federal Administrative Court in 2007, where it has struggled to find acceptance mainly due to organisational reasons.</span> </p>

In the following case study, the motivation behind the migration will be elaborated upon and the relative advantages and disadvantages resulting from the shift to open source applications will be discussed from the user’s point of view. </span></p>

Evolution describes the goal of the city – a modern IT-environment adapted to the <span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span>needs that will arise in a slow but continuous development process. </span></p>

As opposed to the desktop market, the infrastructure arena offers more possibilities for applications on Open Source platforms than for any other. In this case study we look at a province in Italy, which has used Open Source software since 1997 to provide eGovernment services to its citizens. We discuss what was done and how the services evolved over the years. </span></p>

We browse, mail and chat wherever and whenever we want. The same thing holds for large organisations, which deploy their own intranets to provide internal information to employees. But what if most of the employees work abroad, with a large number in risky or unsafe regions? And what if one security leak in the communication could lead to political scandals? </span></p>

Many schools cite the low cost of Linux as the primary motivation, but some also cite the need to teach the use of computers in general, rather than the use of certain software products. This paper looks at the use of Linux and educational applications in a school in Slovakia, a future Member State of the EU. </span></p>

This move was coordinated by the Federal Government's anti-terrorism programme, initiated after the attack in the U.S. on 11th September 2001. This paper describes the background to the migration, what exactly was accomplished, and how. </span></p>

Thi study looks at legal and economic aspects of releasing public sector-developed applications under open source licences. </span></p>

After a study and a pilot project, the organisation decided to switch to Linux on the desktop. This paper examines what was done three years ago and how the KNMI looks back on its experiences. </span></p>

Large-scale examples include the French Ministry of Interior and the city of Munich, but small cases are also common. This paper looks at such a small-scale application in a residential care centre for ill or elderly people, located in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. We look at what has been done and why it makes sense for them to use OpenOffice </span></p>

Though short on financial resources, the region has set very high goals for itself in its Regional Strategy on Information Society. This paper briefly describes the region's strategy and continues to discuss how the use of Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) aids the regional government in achieving its goals. </span></p>
